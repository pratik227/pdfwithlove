## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Absolute Data Sovereignty

#### 1. Local-First Processing
Unlike traditional PDF tools, pdfwithlove operates entirely within your browser's memory. When you select a file, it is **never uploaded** to a server. All operations are executed by your local CPU using client-side WebAssembly and JavaScript engines.

#### 2. No Persistence
We do not use databases, tracking cookies, or persistent storage. Once you close your browser tab or refresh the page, the application state is cleared, and all processed documents are purged from your system's memory (RAM).

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ No server-side processing
- ✅ No data logging or analytics
- ✅ No third-party tracking scripts
- ✅ HTTPS-only in production
- ✅ Content Security Policy headers
